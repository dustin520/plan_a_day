# DayPlan

### Overview
Figure out `what you want to do` or `where you want to eat` based on a `location` that you would like to visit.

### Motivation
As people seem to be getting busier by the day, we need tools to help us plan what we do, like todo lists and calendars. What about for when we
travel and visit new cities. That's what itineraries are for. But what if we want recommendations. We ask our friends. 

What if there was something that could help us share our itineraries and places we visit with our reviews after we visit it, and share that with our
friends. That, I think would be helpful. And now it's possible, with DayPlan.
